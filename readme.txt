Hello everybody! Since two years ago, our team BlackAnt had announced to open source all of our Project. And we will always update this Project. Welcome to give us any advice! Thank you for your support!


This update is as follows: 


1. Add a 360 joystick to control the robot in an easier way.
2. New interactions, personalized UI design and real-time feedback.
3. Add the PTZ Reset button. When you have observed around, you can use it to come back to the initial status quickly.
4. For audio intercom systems, long press the screen to open, tap the screen again to close (old version of the robot are not supported because of hardware reasons)

Next Update notice:
1. New UI design, more utility and attractive.
2. Add Baidu offline map to locate the robot.
3. Adapt to the new communicating protocol. More efficient.
